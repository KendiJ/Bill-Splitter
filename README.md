# Share Cost 

This is a simple Flutter Application that helps people share cost of any goods they purchase.

If you wish to give a tip, the app is able to show how much each person should contribute. It splits the bill equally depending on the mumber of perticipants.

The app uses Firebase as the database. 

Since it's not acomplex app, the satemanagent pattern used is setState()

Added a print reciepts feature to show users how they shared the cost, which is in PDF format.
